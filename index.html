                <br />

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="body-text"><b>Goal:</b> identify usability and accessibility issues in a public webpage and
                    create a new design for it</p>

                <p class="body-text"><b>How:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>analyze the existing page and look for problems</li>
                    <li>design low-fi and high-fi prototypes for the new page</li>
                    <li>create the new responsive page in HTML/CSS compatible with 3 device sizes</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>The website of choice: <a href="https://www.bccls.org/" target="_blank">https://www.bccls.org/</a>
                </h3>

                <div class="img-wrapper">
                    <a href="assets/ogwebsite.png" target="_blank">
                        <img src="assets/ogwebsite.png" alt="Original BCCLS website">
                    </a>
                </div>

                <p>I chose this website for my local library account at home. I use this once every couple of months and
                    every time, I find myself having to scan the full page of irregularly laid out irreleveant
                    information to find the important stuff I want to access.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Identifying Problems</h2>

                <p>I analyzed the existing webpage, based on usability and accessibility criteria. These issues provided
                    goals to target in the redesign process.</p>

                <h3>Usability</h3>
                <p><b>Biggest reasons why I chose this website: layout and lack of responsiveness</p></b>

                <ul>
                    <li>layout is <b>cluttered and distracting</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>no specific section draws the eyes as being important (except for “apply for an ecard!”
                                button which is styled completely differently to stand out as if it is the
                                thing users want to look for)
                                <div class="img-wrapper">
                                    <a href="assets/ecard.png" target="_blank" style="width: 300px;">
                                        <img src="assets/ecard.png" alt="apply for an ecard">
                                    </a>
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li>as a user, most commonly used sections are the search, login, and find a library
                                sections, which are not clearly distinguished among other <b>random information</b> such
                                as pet
                                pictures</li>
                            <li><b>no clear reading order or visual hierarchy</b> to match the level of relevance of
                                different
                                information</li>
                            <li>partial grid layout but cells are misaligned and all uniform despite varying levels of
                                importance</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><b>inconsistent text styling</b>, especially among links makes unintuitive distinctions between
                        seemingly similar types of text
                        <ul>
                            <li>headings match, but description text varies in size and weight</li>
                            <li>“click here” is different in the "Want Ads" section than in the "Did You Know…” section
                                and from the links in the “Readers' Advisory”

                            <li>“Limited Public Services Offered at Select Libraries!” is outdated announcement
                                linking to post-COVID reopenings, though “public services” is misleading
                                considering services has different meaning in navbar</li>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p><a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WebAIM WAVE</a> was used to detect accessibility
                    issues on the
                    page. Here's a summary of what it reported:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>page language</b> not specified</li>
                    <li>many <b>HTML form elements</b> (text input, dropdowns, radio buttons, etc.) that do not have
                        attached labels
                        <ul>
                            <li>personally, unsure of the severity of this given there is descriptive text next to them
                                so
                                even if not explicitly using a &#60;label&#62; attached to the inputs, screen readers
                                should
                                provide some description</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>some images have <b>alternative text</b> but some do not</li>
                    <li>only a couple of random <b>ARIA tags</b>, no consistent use of them</li>
                    <li>most of the page made good use of hierarchical elements like different <b>heading tags</b>,
                        except for
                        the navigation menu at the bottom</li>
                    <li>
                        “forgot your password?” <b>text is too small</b> in login section
                        <div class="img-wrapper">
                            <a href="assets/login.png" target="_blank" style="width: 300px;">

                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>many flagged <b>contrast errors</b> for the white headings on light blue backgrounds
                        <ul>
                            <li>after desaturating the page most do not seem <em>too</em> severe except for one under
                                the “Want
                                Ads” section</li>

                            <div class="img-wrapper">
                                <a href="assets/contrasterror.png" target="_blank" style="width: 300px;">
                                    <img src="assets/contrasterror.png" alt="Contrast error">
                                </a>

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>I agreed with most of these errors though I was unsure about some of the contrast and form label
                    issues. I also noticed some things that seemed like issues to me that weren't flagged by WAVE such
                    as the fact that the <b>buttons are images not text</b>, though they do have alt text for
                    screenreaders.</p>

                <p>I developed a style guide to define the key aesthetic characteristics of the page including, fonts,
                    colors, and the styling for the major components.</p>

                <p>Having decided on the overall layout and aesthetics of the page components, I turned the low-fi
                    mockups into high-fi mockups for the 3 device sizes in Figma. You can click throught the Figma
                    prototype to view the annotations for each.</p>

                <h2>Redesigned Website</h2>
                <p>Finally, putting all of this together, I built out the webpage using HTML and CSS. No extra
                    frameworks or outside code were used for this, everything was written by me purely from scratch. All
                    images were sourced from the original website and fonts/icons are from Google Fonts (sorry Jeff).

                </h3>

                <p>Note that there are a few elements that currently are not fully finished due to time
                    constraints (and most of them would probably need some JavaScript), but I hope to come back and
                    flesh these out later including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>image slideshow is fully static</li>
                    <li>book browsing carousels are also static (though these do scroll horizontally when overflowed for
                        some
                        responsiveness)</li>
                    <li>minor logo image bugs on mobile
                        <ul>
                            <li>couldn't get the navbar logo to center on mobile and figured it wasn't worth
                                agonizing over any longer :,)</li>
                            <li>footer logo is cut off on some mobile browsers?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>navbar menu (though proof of concept for this is in Figma mockups)
                        <ul>
                            <li>need to display dropdowns on hover</li>
                            <li>hamburger should actually open mobile menu</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This project was a very fun opportunity to practice the design process and exercise my web
                    development skills. In the past, when working on websites I was more focused on aesthetic design
                    than usability, but this project has encouraged me to prioritize key learnability, memorability, and
                    efficiency when designing this type of interface.
