                <br />

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="body-text"><b>Goal:</b> identify usability and accessibility issues in a public webpage and
                    create a new design for it</p>

                <p class="body-text"><b>How:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>analyze the existing page and look for problems</li>
                    <li>design low-fi and high-fi prototypes for the new page</li>
                    <li>create the new responsive page in HTML/CSS compatible with 3 device sizes</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>The website of choice: <a href="https://www.bccls.org/" target="_blank">https://www.bccls.org/</a>
                </h3>

                <div class="img-wrapper">
                    <a href="assets/ogwebsite.png" target="_blank">
                        <img src="assets/ogwebsite.png" alt="Original BCCLS website">
                    </a>
                </div>

                <p>I chose this website for my local library account at home. I use this once every couple of months and
                    every time, I find myself having to scan the full page of irregularly laid out irreleveant
                    information to find the important stuff I want to access.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Identifying Problems</h2>

                <p>I analyzed the existing webpage, based on usability and accessibility criteria. These issues provided
                    goals to target in the redesign process.</p>

                <h3>Usability</h3>
                <p><b>Biggest reasons why I chose this website: layout and lack of responsiveness</p></b>

                <ul>
                    <li>layout is <b>cluttered and distracting</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>no specific section draws the eyes as being important (except for “apply for an ecard!”
                                button which is styled completely differently to stand out as if it is the
                                thing users want to look for)</li>
                            <li>as a user, most commonly used sections are the search, login, and find a library
                                sections, which are not clearly distinguished among other <b>random information</b> such
                                as pet
                                pictures</li>
                            <li><b>no clear reading order or visual hierarchy</b> to match the level of relevance of
                                different
                                information</li>
                            <li>partial grid layout but cells are misaligned and all uniform despite varying levels of
                                importance</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><b>inconsistent text styling</b>, especially among links makes unintuitive distinctions between
                        seemingly similar types of text
                        <ul>
                            <li>headings match, but description text varies in size and weight</li>
                            <li>“click here” is different in the "Want Ads" section than in the "Did You Know…” section
                                and from the links in the “Readers' Advisory”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>much of page content corresponds to info found in dropdown menus but often with different names
                        <ul>
                            <li>“eBCCLS” section is under Digital Collections</li>
                            <li>“Did You Know…” section wants to highlight services which is under Services</li>
                            <li>“Be a Champion” is the same as Support Your Library</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>slideshow in center highlights current events and services which are repeated in other sections
                    </li>

                    <li>other <b>redundant or vaguely named content</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“Limited Public Services Offered at Select Libraries!” is outdated announcement
                                linking to post-COVID reopenings, though “public services” is misleading
                                considering services has different meaning in navbar</li>
                            <li>
                                What is “Browse Search” under catalog search input? just takes you to an empty page with
                                a search bar
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Why is “My Title Lists” under the login?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><b>page is fixed width</b>, with no responsiveness for screen size</li>
                    <li><b>mobile site is just a completely different webpage with different styles for many
                            components</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>page first displays the desktop site on load which is too big detailed for the phone,
                                mobile site loads after a few seconds
                            </li>
                            <li>scrolling to the bottom of this site shows actual navigation menu with a button to show
                                full desktop site</li>
                            <li>also a button to open “classic mobile site” which is a <em>whole other site</em> with
                                its own
                                problems that we don't have the time to get into…</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>most of the information from the desktop site is hidden</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>pros: distills down clutter</b> and highlights essential functionality
                                unlike
                                desktop site</li>
                            <li><b>cons: poor memorability, disorienting when switching devices</b> especially for users
                                used to one or
                                other</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p><a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WebAIM WAVE</a> was used to detect accessibility
                    issues on the
                    page. Here's a summary of what it reported:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>page language</b> not specified</li>
                    <li>many <b>HTML form elements</b> (text input, dropdowns, radio buttons, etc.) that do not have
                        attached labels
                        <ul>
                            <li>personally, unsure of the severity of this given there is descriptive text next to them
                                so
                                even if not explicitly using a &#60;label&#62; attached to the inputs, screen readers
                                should
                                provide some description</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>some images have <b>alternative text</b> but some do not</li>
                    <li>only a couple of random <b>ARIA tags</b>, no consistent use of them</li>
                    <li>most of the page made good use of hierarchical elements like different <b>heading tags</b>,
                        except for
                        the navigation menu at the bottom</li>
                    <li>“forgot your password?” <b>text is too small</b> in login section</li>
                    <li>many flagged <b>contrast errors</b> for the white headings on light blue backgrounds
                        <ul>
                            <li>after desaturating the page most do not seem <em>too</em> severe except for one under
                                the “Want
                                Ads” section</li>

                            <div class="img-wrapper">
                                <a href="assets/contrasterror.png" target="_blank" style="width: 50%;">
                                    <img src="assets/contrasterror.png" alt="Contrast error" style="width: 50%;">
                                </a>
                            </div>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>I agreed with most of these errors though I was unsure about some of the contrast and form label
                    issues. I also noticed some things that seemed like issues to me that weren't flagged by WAVE such
                    as the fact that the <b>buttons are images not text</b>, though they do have alt text for
                    screenreaders.</p>

                <h2>Low-Fi Mockups</h2>
                <p>Using Balsamiq, I designed and annotated low-fi wireframe prototypes of my new redesigned version of
                    the site for 3
                    different devices sizes: desktop, tablet and mobile.</p>

                <p>I developed a style guide to define the key aesthetic characteristics of the page including, fonts,

                    mockups into high-fi mockups for the 3 device sizes in Figma.</p>

                <p>Finally, putting all of this together, I built out the webpage using HTML and CSS. No extra
                    frameworks or outside code were used for this, everything was written by me purely from scratch. All
                    images were sourced from the original website and fonts/icons are from Google Fonts (sorry Jeff).

                <p>This project was a very fun opportunity to practice the design process and exercise my web
                    development skills. In the past, when working on websites I was more focused on aesthetic design
